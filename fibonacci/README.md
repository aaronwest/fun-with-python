## Generating the Fibonacci Sequence in Python

These are different methods for producing the [Fibonacci sequence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fibonacci_number) in Python.

* **fibonacci.py** - use an array and while loop to generate _N_ number of Fibonacci numbers
* **fibonacci2.py** - use generators and the yield keyword to print numbers of the Fibonacci sequence between _start number_ and _end number_
